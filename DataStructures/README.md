# Data Structures

A list of data structures you need to know for interviews. I will include some references and examples for the following basic data structures. The list is taken from Gayle Laakmann McDowell's famous book Cracking the Coding Interview. Since the original book uses Java for examples, I don't know if I can always find the counter parts in C# successfully.

* Linked Lists
* Binary Treees
* Tries
* Stacks
* Queues
* Vectors / ArrayLists
* Hash Tables
