# Concepts

A list of concepts you need to know for interviews. I will include some references and examples for the following basic concepts. The list is taken from Gayle Laakmann McDowell's famous book Cracking the Coding Interview. Since the original book uses Java for examples, I don't know if I can always find the counter parts in C# successfully.

* Bit Manipulation
* Singleton Design Pattern
* Factory Design Pattern
* Memory (Stack vs. Heap)
* Recursion
* Big-O Time
